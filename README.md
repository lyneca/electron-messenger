# Electron Messenger
A Facebook Messenger client written in [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Electron](http://electron.atom.io)

I made this on a [low-powered laptop](https://www.jbhifi.com.au/computers-tablets/laptops/acer/acer-aspire-r3-131t-c1ew-11-6-2-in-1-notebook/810144/) so that I could access [messenger](messenger.com) on said low powered laptop without [running out of RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe).

## Features

### Normal Messenger Features
 - Send/receive messages
 - Send/receive images (not stickers yet)
 - Thread list

### Other Features
 - Dark theme
 - Quick search hotkey (press )

Obviously this project is still in development, but at the moment it's faster and more memory-efficient than messenger.com in a browser, and it does ~80% of what I normally use messenger for - it sends messages.

I plan to integrate some features that are not currently in messenger, such as unlimited colour changing (i.e. more than the 15-20 colours Facebook currently provides). A lot of the stuff in my [powertool](https://github.com/lyneca/facebook-messenger-tool) might see its way into here as well.
